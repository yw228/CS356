        <h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Big Box Gas is a free web APP and SERVICE built and provided by Daniel Flanagan intended for use as is.</p>
        <p>Privacy polices are typically long, boring, and redundant, this one strives not to be.  This page informs users of the polices in place concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by this App and its associated Services.  By choosing to use this App you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined by this policy.</p>
        <h2 id="information-collection-and-use">Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>In order to function as a Service, the App collects location data, either as a search query or as the user&#39;s device&#39;s current GPS position.  This data is used to operate the service ephemerally and is never stored nor associated with an individual user.  User preferences are stored locally on the user&#39;s device and are only shared ephemerally with the Service when the user is using the App.</p>
        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>Whenever possible all user data transmitted between the App and the Service is encrypted.  User data is never stored by the Service and is only stored by the App at the explicit request of the user.  User data is permanently deleted from the App at the immediate request of the user.</p>
        <h2 id="third-party-service-providers">Third Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
        <h3 id="google-fonts">Google Fonts</h3>
        <p>The fonts used by the App are served by Google Fonts which &quot;is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to only what is needed to serve fonts efficiently.&quot; • <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq#what_does_using_the_google_fonts_api_mean_for_the_privacy_of_my_users">More Information</a> • <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
        <h3 id="glitch">Glitch</h3>
        <p>The App and the Service are hosted by Glitch and all traffic is routed through their infrastructure. • <a href="https://glitch.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
        <h2 id="outside-links">Outside Links</h2>
        <p>The App may contain links to sites and services not controlled by the App or the Service in which case clicking on one of those links subjects you to the Privacy Policy of the third party.</p>
        <h2 id="children-s-privacy">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App and Service do not address or target anyone under the age of 13.  It does not knowingly collect personally identifiable from children under the age of 13.  Parents or guardians of children under 13 should use the contact section below to address any concerns at once.</p>
        <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy may change from time to time, as such you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
        <p>This policy is effective as of June 29, 2022.</p>
